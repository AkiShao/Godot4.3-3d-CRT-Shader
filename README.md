## Usage

To use this shader, you can consult godot official docs:[高级后期处理](https://docs.godotengine.org/zh-cn/4.x/tutorials/shaders/advanced_postprocessing.html)
You can simply create a MeshInstance3D and use it as its shader material.
If you want to modify parameters, you can modify them at the beginning of the file. Although I suggest to use the parameters I set since they were perfect to me.
